# STL to GCode Converter

This is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for opening STL files, visualizing them, and converting them to G-code. The application leverages `Tkinter` for the GUI, `numpy-stl` for handling STL files, and `matplotlib` for 3D visualization.

## Features

- **Open STL File**: Allows users to open an STL file from their local system.
- **3D Visualization**: Displays the STL model in a 3D plot for easy inspection.
- **G-code Conversion**: Converts the STL file into G-code for 3D printing or CNC machining.
- **Menu Options**:
  - **Help**: Instructions for using the application.
  - **About**: Information about the application and its developer.
  - **Sponsor**: Provides sponsorship options to support the project.
